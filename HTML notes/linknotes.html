        Link notes and testing
        The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
        <a href="url">link text</a>
        -->

        <!-- A link's target indicates where it is opened. -->
        <!-- A _blank target indicates it is opened in a new tab or window. -->
        <a href="https://google.ca" target="_blank">This opens in new tab.</a>

        <!-- A _self target indicates it is opened in the same tab -->
        <a href="https://google.ca" target="_self">This opens in the same tab.</a>

        <!--
        An absolute URL is a full address, like above.
        A relative URL is a local link (within the same website) and excludes the "https://www"
        -->

        <!-- We can use images as links. -->
        <a href="https://google.ca">
            <img src="https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/archive/OQIVyXMLyWteDGUbQkf7_monkey.jpg">
        </a>

        <!-- We can link to an email address -->
        <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

        <!-- The title of the link is what appears as the mouse over -->
        <a href="https://google.ca" title="Go to Google">Mouse over this</a>

        <!-- We can jump to different parts of the page by using "bookmarks" -->
        <h2 id="bookmark">This will be jumped to when we click the link.</h2>
        <a href="#bookmark">This jumps to the bookmark.</a>
